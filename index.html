  <h1>Hello Turtle Fans! </h1>
  <!-- What I did before codeworks -->
  <!--Before becoming the master of all turtles I was working in remote IT suppot for the two years I have been back in
    Boise. Before that I was doing system design and sales support for a Japanese telecom company whose NA offices were
    based out of Seatle-->
  <!-- What I hope to get our of this course -->
  <!--I am looking to cut my teeth in the industry by learning all I need in order to work as a junior developer. The ultimate goal is project management/ Team Lead / Lead Dev for a game studio. I am looking  to complete my MBA in the next couple years as well to help round out my skills. Although I am a creative person I am not ...artistically gifted... so story or art development is not the right path for me to a management role.  -->
  <!-- Things I enjoy -->
  <!--My favorite hobbies are trap shooting , fishing, and video games. I do not enjoy single player games at all and spend most of my free time playing multiple games spanning multiple genres , so long as they are multiplayer. I also really enjoy memes and conspiracy theories. And conspiracy theories about memes.-->
  <p>I like turtles, and I hope you do too</p>
